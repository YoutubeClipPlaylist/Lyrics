[Verse 1]
She's shallow like the shoreline during low tide
But my hopes are not quite as high
Can't spot her faults but she spotted mine
She left me for herself
Considering I would too

[Chorus]
Go figure, I'm bigger than that
Go figure, I'm bigger than that

[Verse 2]
The battles only halfway done
I might look young
But I'm no less defeated
How's the weather up there?

[Bridge]
She left me for herself
Considering I would too

Good God I wish I was tall
Good God I wish [X4]

[Chorus][X2]
