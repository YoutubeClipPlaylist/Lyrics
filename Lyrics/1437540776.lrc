[00:00.704]You've been in the shadows
[00:02.700]Feeling kinda low
[00:04.911]Fighting in a battle
[00:06.440]With nothing left to gain
[00:09.165]Even in the fire
[00:11.539]You've been feeling cold
[00:13.614]I can see you hurting
[00:15.101]But I just wanna say
[00:16.893]It will be alright
[00:19.798]When you feeling lonely
[00:21.266]I'll stay by your side
[00:23.956]I will be the only one
[00:25.932]To hold you when the sun don't shine
[00:28.429]Even through your darkest night
[00:30.294]I'll guide you to the light
[00:35.165]I'll keep you by my side
[00:37.841]All day all night
[00:40.036]Just you and I
[00:43.846]This love will never die
[00:46.516]We'll stay alive
[00:48.662]Just you and I
[00:51.422]We can do anything
[01:10.494]Swimming in a silence
[01:12.545]You don't make a sound
[01:14.747]Got voices in your head
[01:16.157]So you try to drown 'em out
[01:19.060]I know I'm not a hero
[01:21.133]But I hear you calling out
[01:23.350]I'll be there to save you
[01:25.035]When nobody's around
[01:26.768]It will be alright
[01:29.347]When you feeling lonely
[01:31.124]I'll stay by your side
[01:33.994]I will be the only one
[01:35.755]To hold you when the sun don't shine
[01:38.270]Even through your darkest night
[01:40.172]I'll guide you to the light
[01:44.883]I'll keep you by my side
[01:47.634]All day all night
[01:49.746]Just you and I
[01:53.682]This love will never die
[01:56.315]We'll stay alive
[01:58.508]Just you and I
[02:01.221]We can do anything
