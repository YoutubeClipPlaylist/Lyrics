[00:00.000] 作曲 : Ayase
[00:07.97]Don’t know where we disconnected each of our stories
[00:11.57]Now we go, once again, past where we have split off
[00:15.36]Even if, many times, we have been separated, you can see
[00:19.97]We’re connected, still
[00:21.77]
[00:28.57]So, goodbye, farewell then
[00:30.43]We said the words, departed
[00:32.47]How many morning suns have we seen ever since that day
[00:36.29]In our respective new future destinations
[00:40.09]Extension of that day
[00:41.90]Today is when we meet
[00:43.47]
[00:43.65]With every moment that leads up to our meeting time
[00:47.22]I keep feeling my heart beating louder as the seconds pass
[00:50.97]As I look up at the sky that has cleared from the rain
[00:54.74]It was just like what we saw that day
[00:57.81]Upon us was a seven-colored bridge
[01:00.48]
[01:00.66]Here and now, we were able to meet once again
[01:03.99]We have kept our connection alive all along
[01:07.86]The things we talk about
[01:09.05]We wanna speak about
[01:09.99]Are never ending, overflowing out, and so
[01:12.42]Hold up, this won’t be loosening, for we know
[01:15.30]We were rushed by the seasons, forever moving
[01:18.96]And beyond where the roads could be leading us to
[01:22.80]No matter where we stand
[01:23.93]As often as we want
[01:24.92]We gotta tie our strings together like before
[01:27.44]We’ll meet again soon
[01:29.16]
[01:29.62]What was this?
[01:31.15]And now, we cannot end the reminiscence
[01:33.13]And those recollections, retentions
[01:34.49]We trace and we laugh
[01:36.26]Filling in sceneries we were living apart
[01:37.86]The conversation offer a shortcut
[01:39.60]And we don’t even need to worry about tomorrow
[01:41.67]As if in a machine, and we’re back to our past
[01:43.27]
[01:43.58]In any case
[01:44.89]Some changes that each of us have witnessed
[01:48.20]In total honesty, there’s been too much of them
[01:51.77]But we know, till this day
[01:54.46]It’s all of our surprise
[01:56.47]That everything is still the same
[02:00.38]
[02:12.71]When we look up at the sky, notice it’s turning white
[02:16.30]We’re exhausted and we see upon one side of our cheeks
[02:20.10]A gentle touch and a stroke from the warmth of the sun
[02:23.82]It was just like what we saw that day
[02:26.75]We return to our individual days
[02:29.39]
[02:30.01]Hey, every step that each of us have walked up to now
[02:33.25]Has been on separate pathways, we know
[02:36.90]But the same morning sun is above and shining bright on us
[02:41.65]We’ve got to, once again, overlap now
[02:44.46]
[02:46.42]Don’t know where we lost connection within our stories
[02:49.92]Once again, we return to what lies there beyond
[02:53.67]The things we talk about
[02:54.77]We wanna speak about
[02:55.79]The pages will soon be filling up, you’ll see
[02:58.54]So, now, let’s keep on adding to the story
[03:01.22]Even the setting red sun we looked up at once
[03:04.90]And the blue days of youth we have spent together
[03:08.71]Our memories won’t forget
[03:09.91]Never to fade away
[03:10.94]And like the way the greens will always sprout
[03:13.42]We can meet again some time
[03:15.86]Our stories always start
[03:17.53]With a white morning sunshine every time, and so
[03:20.90]“See ya tomorrow”
[03:22.57]
