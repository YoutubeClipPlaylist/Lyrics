[00:07.698]Wanna see in a different time
[00:11.456]If well come back to know what were feeling like
[00:14.699]But all the while I see my way
[00:18.202]And know that I couldn’t take it
[00:20.460]I’m wearing my heart on my sleeve and
[00:23.209]Anything goes when
[00:24.950]Trying to make it come from it all
[00:28.447]And I’ll tell you how I feel
[00:30.451]Whether you want
[00:31.957]Cause I know I’m meant to
[00:34.701]And I’ll tell you
[00:36.206]If we’re better but I couldn’t make it
[00:39.698]Could it happen well I couldn’t say it
[00:43.460]On the way you keep all it retained
[00:46.456]And know that
[00:48.197]You’re coming from zero
[00:50.954]It all feels like a constant dream
[00:54.198]To know that we tryna find a home
[00:57.698]And while it feels like the end to me
[01:01.212]I don’t think I understand it yet
[01:03.458]And if I didn’t I’m
[01:04.447]Trying to get my focus safely
[01:07.947]To go on a whim while I am changing

[01:13.395]Just Spare me while aging
[01:15.151]But don’t do enough for you

[01:20.156]Couldn’t know what’s next
[01:21.905]When I’m
[01:22.646]Wasting time
[01:23.645]Like a holiday
[01:25.402]And if I had enough
[01:27.148]Well I’d never say
[01:28.898]I’d see you when
[01:30.902]I’d need to then
[01:32.648]But I just can’t be
[01:34.395]What you want me to
[01:36.160]Cause if I did then
[01:37.906]I would be like you
[01:39.723]And if I die young
[01:41.633]Would you take a guess
[01:43.380]And just show me how
[01:45.134]If this is what u get
[01:46.636]I’m wearing my heart on my sleeve and
[01:49.167]Anything goes when
[01:50.875]Trying to make it come from it all
[01:54.371]And I’ll tell you how I feel
[01:56.135]Whether you want
[01:57.872]Cause I know I’m meant to
[02:00.630]And I’ll tell you
[02:02.123]If we’re better but I couldn’t make it
[02:05.883]Could it happen well I couldn’t say it
[02:09.372]On the way you keep all it retained
[02:12.872]And know that
[02:14.128]You’re coming from zero
