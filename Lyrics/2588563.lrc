[00:01.394]I sat outside my front window this story's going somewhere
[00:06.612]He's well hung and I am hanging up
[00:11.588]Well there's a song on the radio that says
[00:17.402]Let's get this party started
[00:20.198]Let's get this party started
[00:23.571]What you do on your own time's just fine
[00:26.389]My imagination's much worse I just never want to know
[00:34.01]What meant the world imploded faded and demoted
[00:38.890]All my oxygen to product gas
[00:42.321]And suffocated my last chance
[00:45.29]You said between your smiles and regrets don't say it's over
[00:58.47]Dead and gone dead and gone
[01:09.65]Calm before the storm set it off and the sun burnt out tonight
[01:20.102]A reception less than warm set it off and the sun burnt out tonight
[01:29.684]The next time the phone can wring my neck
[01:32.458]It gets no answer
[01:34.10]And the time that I've spent telling in my roots
[01:38.499]I'm shaking in my boots
[01:40.343]But still it looks at me like an old friend I've betrayed
[01:45.370]The dark side of the doormat is the one your shoes have frayed
[01:51.39]What you do on your own time's just fine
[01:53.634]My imagination's much worse I just never want to know
[02:01.403]What meant the world imploded faded and demoted
[02:06.395]All my oxygen to product gas
[02:09.682]And suffocated my last chance
[02:12.522]You said between your smiles and regrets don't say it's over
[02:25.459]Dead and gone dead and gone
[02:36.703]Calm before the storm set it off and the sun burnt out tonight
[02:47.559]A reception less than warm set it off and the sun burnt out tonight
[03:48.997]Calm before the storm set it off and the sun burnt out tonight
[04:00.298]Reception less than warm
[04:03.124]Set it off and the sun burnt out tonight
[04:11.632]Tonight
[04:14.873]Sun burnt out
[04:19.03]Sun burnt out tonight
[04:28.553]The sun burnt out tonight
